# Game Theoretic Motion Planning for Serial Manipulators

## Overview
GamePlanManipulator is a project that explores game theoretic approaches to motion planning for serial manipulators sharing the same workspace. This project aims to develop algorithms and strategies that enable multiple manipulators to collaborate effectively and efficiently in dynamic environments.

## Features
- **Game Theoretic Framework**: Utilizes principles from game theory to model interactions between multiple manipulators and their environment.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Implements collision avoidance techniques to ensure the safe operation of the manipulators in shared workspaces.
- **Dynamic Environment Adaptation**: Adapts motion planning strategies in real-time to respond to changes in the environment or task requirements.
- **Optimization**: Seeks to optimize various performance metrics such as efficiency, speed, and energy consumption while considering the strategic interactions among manipulators.
